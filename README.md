<h2>🚦 Simple Expert System for Traffic Light Control</h2>
This is a rule-based expert system that simulates a traffic light control system based on traffic density. It adjusts the duration of the green light dynamically using IF-THEN rules, making intelligent decisions for efficient traffic management.

<h2>Features</h2>
✅ Uses expert system rules for traffic control<br>
✅ Adjusts green light duration based on traffic density (High/Medium/Low)<br>
✅ Implements a simple inference mechanism<br>
✅ Continuously cycles through RED → GREEN → YELLOW → RED

<h2>How to Run</h2>
🔹 Clone the repository:<br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harriii2/Traffic-Light-Control.git
cd Traffic-Light-Control
```<br>
🔹 Run the script:<br>
```bash
python TrafficLight.py
```<br>
🔹 Enter traffic density (High, Medium, or Low) when prompted<br>
