<h2>ðŸš¦ Simple Expert System for Traffic Light Control</h2>
This is a rule-based expert system that simulates a traffic light control system based on traffic density. It adjusts the duration of the green light dynamically using IF-THEN rules, making intelligent decisions for efficient traffic management.

<h2>Features</h2>
âœ… Uses expert system rules for traffic control<br>
âœ… Adjusts green light duration based on traffic density (High/Medium/Low)<br>
âœ… Implements a simple inference mechanism<br>
âœ… Continuously cycles through RED â†’ GREEN â†’ YELLOW â†’ RED

<h2>How to Run</h2>
ðŸ”¹Clone the repository<br>
ðŸ”¹Run the script:<br>
ðŸ”¹python traffic_light_expert.py<br>
ðŸ”¹Enter traffic density (High, Medium, or Low) when prompted<br>
