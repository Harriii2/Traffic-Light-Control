# ðŸš¦ Simple Expert System for Traffic Light Control

This is a rule-based expert system that simulates a traffic light control system based on traffic density. It adjusts the duration of the green light dynamically using IF-THEN rules, making intelligent decisions for efficient traffic management.

## Features
âœ… Uses expert system rules for traffic control  
âœ… Adjusts green light duration based on traffic density (High/Medium/Low)  
âœ… Implements a simple inference mechanism  
âœ… Continuously cycles through RED â†’ GREEN â†’ YELLOW â†’ RED

    ```

2. **Run the script:**

    Run the following command to execute the script:
    ```bash
    python TrafficLight.py
    ```

3. **Input the traffic density:**

    When prompted, enter one of the following values for traffic density:
    - **High**
